# Contributing to 4evergent

Thank you for contributing. This document covers development setup, repository structure, testing, code style, PR expectations, and security reporting.

## Development setup

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/naninu123/4evergent
cd 4evergent

# install (Node 22+, pnpm 10+)
pnpm install

# optional: local environment (loaded automatically by the API server)
cp .env.example .env

# build all packages
pnpm build
```

> **On a fresh checkout, run `pnpm build` before `pnpm typecheck`.**
> Workspace packages resolve each other through their build output: e.g.
> `packages/shared/package.json` points `types`/`main` at `./dist/index.*`, and
> `packages/agent-core` imports `@4evergent/shared`. Before the first build that
> `dist/` does not exist, so `pnpm typecheck` fails with
> `TS2307: Cannot find module '@4evergent/shared'`. The same ordering is used in
> CI (`Build` runs before `Typecheck`).

## Testing

Run the full test suite:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Or run a single package:

```bash
pnpm --filter @4evergent/policy test
pnpm --filter @4evergent/agent-core test
```

Each package uses `tsx --test` as its test runner. Tests live in `test/` within each package.

### Test coverage

Run coverage for every test stack with:

```bash
pnpm test:coverage
```

The Node test-runner stacks use Node's built-in coverage reporter through `tsx`; the web stack uses Vitest's V8 provider (`@vitest/coverage-v8`, a web-only development dependency). The command prints each stack's per-file report and a combined summary. Rust contract tests are not part of this command.

The baseline below was measured at the issue branch's merge base on Node 24.18.0 with `pnpm test:coverage` (662 Node tests and 222 web tests passed). Integer thresholds are set below measured line and branch results by rounding down to whole percentages; the 100% shared line result uses a 99% gate for a small cushion. The CI workflow uses Node 22; these floors are deliberately conservative, but should be revisited if the Node 22 report differs.

| Stack | Tests passed | Lines | Branches | Functions | Line gate | Branch gate |
|-------|-------------:|------:|---------:|----------:|----------:|------------:|
| API | 335 | 87.68% | 74.64% | 85.78% | 87% | 74% |
| CLI | 106 | 72.13% | 53.14% | 79.21% | 72% | 52% |
| Database | 101 | 74.08% | 84.52% | 60.62% | 74% | 84% |
| Policy | 31 | 65.36% | 90.54% | 91.67% | 65% | 90% |
| Stellar | 68 | 70.10% | 75.72% | 89.13% | 70% | 75% |
| Agent core | 11 | 52.31% | 62.50% | 46.67% | 52% | 62% |
| Shared | 10 | 100.00% | 92.86% | 100.00% | 99% | 92% |
| Web | 222 | 82.07% | 80.91% | 75.00% | 81% | 80% |

The CLI branch result varied slightly across two complete runs (52.96% and 53.14%); the recorded value is from the final run, and its 52% gate remains below both measurements. No CI coverage step is added, so the normal workflow does not run the suite twice; use `pnpm test:coverage` locally to see reports and enforce the measured floors.

Every capability must include:
- Unit tests for intent validation
- Policy engine tests (positive + all negative cases)
- Integration test against the Horizon testnet API
- Negative tests (see below)

### Negative test cases to cover

- Amount exceeds per-tx limit
- Amount exceeds daily spending limit
- Unauthorized asset
- Unauthorized destination
- Unauthorized contract ID
- Malformed intent (missing fields)
- Missing human approval for threshold amount
- Invalid agent owner

## Working on contracts/

Run cargo from inside `contracts/` (`cd contracts && cargo test`) so `contracts/rust-toolchain.toml` (pinned 1.81.0) applies. The wasm target is `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. `contracts/Cargo.lock` is committed on purpose — builds are reproducible via `--locked`; use `CARGO_RESOLVER_INCOMPATIBLE_RUST_VERSIONS=fallback cargo generate-lockfile` when dependencies change so the MSRV-aware resolver keeps versions 1.81-compatible.

## Code style

- TypeScript with strict mode enabled.
- All relative imports use explicit `.ts` extensions (Node ESM).
- Use `Exact Optional Property Types` — no implicit `undefined`.
- Prefer pure functions for policy/engine logic.
- Run `pnpm lint` (ESLint flat config at the repo root). `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`
  is an error and ignores names prefixed with `_`; `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` is
  off on purpose. Keep lint fixes mechanical and in-scope for the PR.

## PR expectations

- All tests must pass (`pnpm test`).
- Lint must pass (`pnpm lint`).
- Typecheck must pass (`pnpm typecheck`) — run `pnpm build` first on a fresh checkout.
- Include tests for any new intent type, policy rule, or capability.
- Add entries to `docs/architecture.md` if you make an architecture decision.
- Link the PR to a GitHub issue where applicable.
- PRs should be scoped — one capability per PR is ideal.

## Security reporting

If you find a security vulnerability:

1. Do NOT open a public issue.
2. Report it through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting on the
   [naninu123/4evergent repository](https://github.com/naninu123/4evergent/security/advisories/new)
   (Security tab → "Report a vulnerability"). If that mechanism is
   unavailable, open a GitHub security advisory draft or contact the maintainer,
   @naninu123, directly on GitHub.
3. Include: description, reproduction steps, potential impact.
4. You will receive a response within 48 hours.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full policy.
